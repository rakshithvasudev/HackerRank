Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/big-sorting
Consider an array of numeric strings, , where each string is a positive number with anywhere from  to  digits. Sort the array's elements in non-decreasing (i.e., ascending) order of their real-world integer values and print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of strings in . 
Each of the  subsequent lines contains a string of integers describing an element of the array.

Constraints

Each string is guaranteed to represent a positive integer without leading zeros.
The total number of digits across all strings in  is between  and  (inclusive).
Output Format

Print each element of the sorted array on a new line.

Explanation 0

The initial array of strings is . When we order each string by the real-world integer value it represents, we get:

We then print each value on a new line, from smallest to largest.
